# ðŸ¤– Robotics Simulator

A modular, Scala-based robot simulator in which autonomous, simple-minded robots navigate a grid-based world. This project showcases object-oriented design, AI behaviors, and simulation logic through an extendable and visual environment.


---

## Project Overview

**Robotics** is a simulation game where various robot types move through a world made of walls and floor tiles. Each robot has its own behavior ("brain") and a physical body. The simulation takes place on a grid, and players can observe how different robots behave over time.

## Components

| Component         | Description                                                                 
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `GridPos`        | Represents a position on the grid.                                          
| `Grid`           | Abstract base for grid systems.                                             
| `CompassDir`     | Enum for directions: north, east, south, west.                              
| `RobotBody`      | Physical body of a robot (location, state, direction).                      
| `RobotBrain`     | AI interface for robot behaviors.                                           
| `Spinbot`, `Nosebot`, etc. | Subclasses defining unique behaviors.                            
| `Square`         | Base trait for world tiles.                                                 
| `Floor`          | A walkable tile in the world.                                               
| `Wall`           | A shared object representing impassable wall tiles.                         
| `RobotWorld`     | The simulation environment containing robots and tiles.
